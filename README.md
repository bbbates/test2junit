# test2junit

Leiningen plug-in to output test results to JUnit XML format.
  
This plug-in writes test results to files in JUnit XML format.
These files can be used, e.g., with junitreport for creating reports in HTML format.
  
You can tweak some setting via your project.clj file:

The directory to which the results are written can be set with :test2junit-output-dir

To run Ant automatically set :test2junit-run-ant to true.


Examplary junitreport output based on the output as generated by this plug-in is available at:
http://ruedigergad.github.com/clj-assorted-utils/test-results/html/

To use this plug-in simply add [test2junit "1.0.1"] either to your .lein/profile.clj or as development dependency to an individual project. test2junit requires Leiningen 2.x.

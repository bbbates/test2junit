# test2junit

Output test results to JUnit XML format.
  
This plug-in writes test results to files in JUnit XML format.
These files can be used, e.g., with junitreport for creating reports in HTML format.
Please see the webpage for more information: https://github.com/ruedigergad/test2junit
  
You can tweak some setting via your project.clj file:
The directory to which the results are written can be set with :test2junit-output-dir
To run Ant automatically set :test2junit-run-ant to true.

Examplary junitreport output based on the output as generated by this plug-in is available at:
